# JavaScript Promises & Observables

To play with JavaScript Promises and Observables, clone this repository
and run the following command to install the dependencies:

```
$ npm install
```

Then you can run the following command to fire up the development web
server:

```
$ npm run serve
```

The project compiles and loads main.ts, so if you want to change which
example gets loaded, you'll need to edit main.ts, and change which
example is being imported, such as:

```
import './promises/promises-06';
```
